# CodeQuest: Interactive Coding Challenge Platform

> "CodeQuest empowers programming learners and educators with a modern, collaborative, and AI-assisted learning experience."

## Features

* **Rich Problem Authoring**: Use canvas, block-based rich text, and AI tools to write and format custom algorithmic problems.
* **Multi-language Code Execution**: Supports over 60 programming languages via a self-hosted Judge0 backend.
* **AI Integration (OpenAI)**: Automatically generate problem descriptions, solutions, and explanations in LeetCode style.
* **Real-time Collaboration**: Edit documents simultaneously with live cursor, inline comments, and online status indicators.
* **Document & Problem Management**: Group documents, manage permissions, publish problems, and track user progress.
* **Personalized Practice**: Customize test cases, track progress, and receive AI-driven problem recommendations.
* **Contest Mode**: Organize programming contests with scoring, time constraints, and leaderboards.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router, Server Actions), TailwindCSS, Shadcn/UI
* **Editor**:

  * Rich text: Novel (ProseMirror-based)
  * Code: Monaco Editor (VSCode-like)
  * Canvas: Tldraw for visual problem illustrations
* **Realtime**: Convex (realtime DB + serverless functions), Liveblocks (cursor sync, presence)
* **Authentication**: Clerk (email, OAuth, Magic Link, role-based access)
* **Execution Engine**: Judge0 (self-hosted, sandboxed, multi-language)
* **AI Services**: OpenAI API (problem generation, text proofreading, simplification)

## System Architecture

* **Frontend**: SSR/CSR hybrid with Server Actions
* **Backend**: Convex (TypeScript functions and realtime DB)
* **Compiler Sandbox**: Dockerized Judge0 for running and evaluating user code
* **Authentication Layer**: Clerk for session management and access control
* **Realtime Sync**: Liveblocks + Convex for concurrent editing and collaboration
